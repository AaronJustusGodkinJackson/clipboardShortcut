# clipboardShortcut
This is a script inspired by a wifi class forcing us to use Aruba controllers that you can't paste more than
5 lines into at once.

Copy your config, run this script, click on your console, and press the shift key, and the program will begin
to paste text line by line, with a delay between lines.

Hopefully this save you time <3
